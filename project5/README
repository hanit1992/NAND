README - This file.
Computer.hdl - This chip is the combination of the parts that build the computer. gets 1 reset input
CPU.hdl - the regular CPU version. this is the chip who executing an input instruction on some input data
CpuMul.hdl - this is an extended cpu. it uses the extended ALU in order to execute instructions.
ExtendedAlu.hdl - this chip is an extention of the ALU, it can also calculate shift and multiplication operations
Memory.hdl - the memory of the computer chip (the RAM). consists of data segments and I\O memmory segments
             we decide by the given address the I\O we would like to activate
Or16Way.hdl - my own chip. i use it for the ALU, in order to decide on the zr and ng valus - activating Or on all the bits
Remarks
-------
i created my own chip to make some of the other chips calculations easier and more organized.
